#Train Your Brain for Success
###By Roger Seip

#####”Read smarter, remember more, and break your own records.”
* Mental factors
  1. Success leaves clues
  2. What you see is what you get
  3. What you see is what you look for
* Bad news: your comfort zone limits you
* Good news: you have the capacity to move your comfort zone because you have chosen it
* Really good news: small changes make a huge difference (winning edge)
* 4 components of record breaking performance
  1. Have energizing goals
  2. Being fully present; using time as it’s meant to be used
  3. Being brilliant with basics
  4. Practicing aggressive mental care

#####Learning Foundation #1: Instant Recall Memory
1. Your instant recall memory
  a. Rote memorization: used to study for tests through repetition **wrong way to remember**
  b. Teachability index
    i. Desire to learn times willingness to change
  c. Don’t judge the process; do evaluate the result
  d. Have fun with your brain
  e. Stress is the number 1 killer of your mental ability

    i. Create vivid image of each item in your mind as clearly as you can
  b. Language of your memory is images
  c. Break things up and give them numbers
  d. Instant recall is the goal
  e. The mental file folder system
    i. F stands for File: use anything you can see with your eyes
    ii. I stand for Image: visualize the information
    iii. G stands for glue: Action and Emotion
  f. Your body—the first filing system
    i. You can see it, it is always with you, and you know the parts of your body without much thought
      1. Your soles

      7. Your collarbone
      8. Your mouth
      9. Your nose
      10. Your forehead
3. Using your new mental files with this book and beyond
  a. Practice new technique with your grocery list
  b. Use the same filing system for multiple sets of information simultaneously by giving each list a title
  c. Take optimal care of your brain
    i. Omega 3 fatty acids: fish oil, flax oil, avocado, walnuts, salmon
      1. Insulate the electrical circuitry in your brain
    ii. Antioxidants: spinach, blueberries, beans of all kinds, broccoli, super fruits, green tea, yogurt, and vitamans
      1. Impact the brain and cadiovascular system
  d. Spaced repitition: the key to long-term recall

      1. Also do random practice instead of sequentially
    iv.  Remembering names, “The sweetest sound to anyone’s ears is the sound of their own name.”
      1. In short term: stoop, clear your mind, and listen
      2. In short term: repeat the person’s name back to them, out loud
      3. In long term: review names of people using spaced repition
      4. In long term: visualize names (ex: an image of Jerry could be ben and jerry’s ice cream)

#####Learning Foundation #2: Your Smart Reading Capacity
* If you read slow, usually because you are **talker** as if you are reading out loud to yourself
* If you are a fast reader means you are a **thinker**
  * Not focused on hearing every word, thinking of the concepts
  * Making connections and actively processing what you read
* **Tuned up:** really fast, not trying to read every word
* Consider the impact of being able to read however fast you want, at whatever level of comprehension you need, based on what’s right for you in your particular situation.
* Concept of gears want to be able to adjust your speed of reading
  * Want to be methodical and detailed when reading a report, contract, or foreign material
  * Other times you want to skim for reading more general material
* Habits to reduce
  * Mind wandering (aka daydreaming)—do so by just reading faster
  * Regression (aka going back)—cut off your escape route
  * Subvoaclization (aka mental whispering)—use your eyes and/or hands ore actively and mindfully engage visual centers of auditory centers
* Your smart reading tools for improved focus and speed
  a. Mechanics of the reading progress
    i. Difference between “speed reading” and “speed looking”
      1. Your eyes and your brain
      2. Your hands can be helpful for enhancing your focus and overall engagement

       1. Fixation: we can only influence how many words we let in between each of the 4 times our eyes stop per second
       2. Eye span: width of text your eyes take in every time your eyes top
         a. Don’t want to just take in one word, want to take in as much as possible, which is how our wpm goes up
         b. Widen your eye span by doing the following:
           i. Look straigt ahead, without moving your head, look as far to your left as you can, then look as far to your right as possible
           ii. Go back and forth on a level playing field 5 times as fast as you can
             1. Break reading each line into chinks and work to expand how much of the line you take in
    iv. Use your hands properly
      1. Use the finger pull technique: pull finger down page vertically at a consistent pace slightly faster than your eyes can keep up with
      2. Pace card technique: place card above the line you are reading
        a. Eliminates the possibility of regression
* Your smart reading tools for enhanced comprehension and retention
