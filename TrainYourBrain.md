#Train Your Brain for Success
###By Roger Seip

#####”Read smarter, remember more, and break your own records.”
* Mental factors
  1. Success leaves clues
  2. What you see is what you get
  3. What you see is what you look for
* Bad news: your comfort zone limits you
* Good news: you have the capacity to move your comfort zone because you have chosen it
* Really good news: small changes make a huge difference (winning edge)
* 4 components of record breaking performance
  1. Have energizing goals
  2. Being fully present; using time as it’s meant to be used
  3. Being brilliant with basics
  4. Practicing aggressive mental care

#####Learning Foundation #1: Instant Recall Memory
1. Your instant recall memory
  1. Rote memorization: used to study for tests through repetition **wrong way to remember**
  2. Teachability index
    1. Desire to learn times willingness to change
  3. Don’t judge the process; do evaluate the result
  4. Have fun with your brain
  5. Stress is the number 1 killer of your mental ability
    1. Take a deep breath and stay relaxed
  6. Baseline memory
    1. The rule of 7, plus or minus 2—on average can usually remember this many things
    2. Primacy and recency—usually the first and last things on a list
2. Learn to speak the language of your memory
  1. Basic and logical association **right way to remember**
    1. Create vivid image of each item in your mind as clearly as you can
  2. Language of your memory is images
  3. Break things up and give them numbers
  4. Instant recall is the goal
  5. The mental file folder system
    1. F stands for File: use anything you can see with your eyes
    2. I stand for Image: visualize the information
    3. G stands for glue: Action and Emotion
  6. Your body—the first filing system
    1. You can see it, it is always with you, and you know the parts of your body without much thought
      1. Your soles
      2. Your shins
      3. Your legs
      4. Your butt
      5. Your stomach
      6. Your ribs
      7. Your collarbone
      8. Your mouth
      9. Your nose
      10. Your forehead
3. Using your new mental files with this book and beyond
  1. Practice new technique with your grocery list
  2. Use the same filing system for multiple sets of information simultaneously by giving each list a title
  3. Take optimal care of your brain
    1. Omega 3 fatty acids: fish oil, flax oil, avocado, walnuts, salmon
      1. Insulate the electrical circuitry in your brain
    2. Antioxidants: spinach, blueberries, beans of all kinds, broccoli, super fruits, green tea, yogurt, and vitamans
      1. Impact the brain and cadiovascular system
  4. Spaced repitition: the key to long-term recall
    1. One hour, while still fresh in mind
    2. One day, after you have slept and had significant time with a different focus
    3. One week, the neural pathway for long-term recall really starts to get cemented
      1. Also do random practice instead of sequentially
    4.  Remembering names, “The sweetest sound to anyone’s ears is the sound of their own name.”
      1. In short term: stoop, clear your mind, and listen
      2. In short term: repeat the person’s name back to them, out loud
      3. In long term: review names of people using spaced repition
      4. In long term: visualize names (ex: an image of Jerry could be ben and jerry’s ice cream)

#####Learning Foundation #2: Your Smart Reading Capacity
* If you read slow, usually because you are **talker** as if you are reading out loud to yourself
* If you are a fast reader means you are a **thinker**
  * Not focused on hearing every word, thinking of the concepts
  * Making connections and actively processing what you read
* **Tuned up:** really fast, not trying to read every word
* Consider the impact of being able to read however fast you want, at whatever level of comprehension you need, based on what’s right for you in your particular situation.
* Concept of gears want to be able to adjust your speed of reading
  * Want to be methodical and detailed when reading a report, contract, or foreign material
  * Other times you want to skim for reading more general material
* Habits to reduce
  * Mind wandering (aka daydreaming)—do so by just reading faster
  * Regression (aka going back)—cut off your escape route
  * Subvoaclization (aka mental whispering)—use your eyes and/or hands ore actively and mindfully engage visual centers of auditory centers
* Your smart reading tools for improved focus and speed
  1. Mechanics of the reading progress
    i. Difference between “speed reading” and “speed looking”
      1. Your eyes and your brain
      2. Your hands can be helpful for enhancing your focus and overall engagement
  1. Understnad your eyes, they jump when reading
    1. Don’t want to be a typerwriter type eye reader
    2. Fast readaer’s eye movement are smoother and more fluid
    3. Two eye-movement terms you should understnad
       1. Fixation: we can only influence how many words we let in between each of the 4 times our eyes stop per second
       2. Eye span: width of text your eyes take in every time your eyes top
         1. Don’t want to just take in one word, want to take in as much as possible, which is how our wpm goes up
         2. Widen your eye span by doing the following:
           1. Look straigt ahead, without moving your head, look as far to your left as you can, then look as far to your right as possible
           2. Go back and forth on a level playing field 5 times as fast as you can
             1. Break reading each line into chinks and work to expand how much of the line you take in
    4. Use your hands properly
      1. Use the finger pull technique: pull finger down page vertically at a consistent pace slightly faster than your eyes can keep up with
      2. Pace card technique: place card above the line you are reading
        1. Eliminates the possibility of regression
* Your smart reading tools for enhanced comprehension and retention
  1. The balance
    1. Reading faster does not hurt your comprehension
      1. Dips at first, but gets stronger
    2. You must be consciously reading
      1. Increase in speed always precedes increase in comprehension
    3. 3 questions to ask yourself  
      1. Why am I reading this?
      2. What do I need this information for?
      3. How much time to I have?
    4. All this will prime your reticular activating system (RAS)
  2. Why an dhow to “smart read”
    1. Biggest leap in reading speed and comprehension will be due to background knowledge
      1. Allows one to more accurately fill the gaps
      2. Helps one figure out which sections to skim over and which ones to take notes on
    2. First deliberately overview a piece of reading material before reading it
      1. Every work of non fiction is started with a writer’s outline
        1. main ideas are found in the outline follow these steps to find it
          1. Read the first paragraph to learn the overarching theme or purpose of the piece
          2. Read the last paragraph to see how the piece is tied together or moves you on to what’s next
          3. Read the first sentence or tow of each paragraph in between usually where the main idea of that paragraph will be found and even the last sentence if your heart desires
    3. use smart reading as a weeding tool, as an overview, or as a review
  3. Key to retention is interactive processing
    1. Ebbinghaus forgetting curve
    2. Retention booster—tuned-up reading
      1. Eye discipline, engaging your hands, using the three questions, smart reading
    3. Retention booster—effective highlighting
      1. It is selective an requires conscious thought, will be at the beginning and end of a paragraph
    4. Retention booster—margin notes
      1.  Next level of engagement 
    5. Retention blaster—full notes
